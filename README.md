## Contributing

We welcome and appreciate new contributions. All changes should be committed to `index.js` only. If you want to add new CSS/JS files please mention in Readme/create a new issue fir reference. Before you open an issue please review below guidelines.

#### Anyone

- Have a look at this Readme. Can it be improved? Do you see typos? You can open a PR or reach out to me at vaibhavgarg237@gmail.com or twitter.

### Creating a PR

When creating a PR please take this points as a reminder:

- If there's not yet an issue for your PR please first [create an issue](https://github.com/vaibhavgarg237/ezPointers/issues/new) with a proposal what you would like to do. This will allow me to give feedback and help you no wasting time and motivation
- Think in iterations (babysteps)\
  You can always start a PR and if you feel like adding on more things to it, better branch off and [create a new i.e. _draft_-PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/)
- If you work on a more complex PR please dm me on gmail/twitter to get feedback, discuss the best way to tackle the challenge, and to ensure that there's no duplication of work. It's often faster and nicer to chat or call about questions than to do ping-pong comments in PRs.

### Code format & preferences

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
